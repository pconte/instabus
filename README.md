Forked!

I forked the Instabus repo in order to replace the Austin-centered map and api calls with Seattle-centered map and api calls.

Eventually, I'd like to focus on the Vashon Island bus routes, combined with real-time ferry positioning data.  Also interpolate the position of the busses between api responses, so that the movement animation is smoother.

# Instabus 6.7

This is a rewrite of https://github.com/luqmaan/instabus.

Why rewrite Instabus?

1. Fetch data from the OneBusAway so that Instabus works for multiple cities (Austin, Tampa, Atlanta, etc.)
2. Add missing features like viewing the schedule for a stop or viewing nearby arrivals
3. Modernize the code, make it easier to read and easier to reason about
4. Be available as mobile apps first through Phonegap and then through React-Native

Check out the issues labeled with `components`, to see what we're thinking for a new layout. https://github.com/open-austin/instabus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acomponents

:warning: The code is still in the very early stages and is not ready for contributions. If you'd like to start contributing code, please let me know so I can have a sense of urgency and get the code ready.
